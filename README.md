### Hi there ~ 
This is my place to share the toys I make. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

I'm a software engineer. Currently 18 years old, always learning. I love to make things that are useful and fun.<br/>
I'm currently working on a few projects that I pinned below.

I'm always open to new ideas and suggestions. Feel free to contact me on Discord. I'm always on there.
